'''
    This module provides back-end Django utilities that make it
    easier to interact with the front-end ajaxform component.

    This module is tightly coupled to ajaxform.js.

    Render a template response to the client, choosing a

    initiated by ajaxform or a browser.

    Typically this is used within a form-based view; `ajax_template_name`
    is usually a partial containing only the form, while
    `template_name` is a full page containing the form.

    Regardless of which template is used, the same context is passed
    into it.
